1/22/26 - Ah Snap!

Despite recovering from surgery and having a cold, I still managed to get ahead of most assignments!

All my repositories are set up for both 3005 and 2450, and I actually understand how to navigate them...to a degree.

Makefiles remain to confuse me, but I think I get classes in C++ now.
